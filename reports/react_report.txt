# Report: How Alita Enables Agents to Create and Deploy MCP Tools When They Do Not Exist

## 1. Identification of Functional Gaps via MCP Brainstorming
Alita begins by assessing its current toolset through the **MCP Brainstorming** component. This module evaluates the agent’s existing capabilities against the requirements of the incoming task. When a mismatch is detected—such as the need to extract subtitles from a YouTube 360‑VR video without an existing tool—MCP Brainstorming flags the gap and initiates the creation process. This step ensures that tool generation is driven by concrete task needs rather than arbitrary pre‑defined workflows.

## 2. Generation of Custom Tools via ScriptGeneratingTool
Once a functional gap is identified, the **ScriptGeneratingTool** is activated. Its responsibilities include:

- **Receiving Detailed Subtask Descriptions**: The manager agent supplies explicit objectives, constraints, and desired outputs.
- **Leveraging External Resources**: A web agent searches for relevant open‑source repositories or code snippets (e.g., `youtube-transcript-api` on GitHub).
- **Constructing Executable Code**: The tool synthesizes the gathered information into a self‑contained script, complete with environment setup instructions such as `conda` or `pip` dependency installation.

The resulting script is modular, reusable, and tailored to the specific task, enabling rapid deployment without manual coding.

## 3. Execution and Validation via CodeRunningTool
The generated script undergoes rigorous testing through the **CodeRunningTool**:

- **Sandboxed Execution**: The script runs in an isolated environment (e.g., a new Conda environment named `youtube_transcript`) to prevent interference with existing systems.
- **Output Caching**: Successful execution results in the tool’s output being cached and stored as a reusable MCP.
- **Iterative Refinement**: If errors arise—such as missing dependencies or syntax issues—the tool automatically initiates recovery steps, adjusting version constraints or regenerating code until the script functions correctly.

This validation loop guarantees that only reliable, fully functional tools are promoted to production.

## 4. Environment Management for Compatibility and Portability
Alita’s environment management system ensures that newly created tools remain compatible across diverse platforms:

- **Isolated Execution Profiles**: Metadata (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `README.md`) is parsed to define precise dependency sets.
- **Dynamic Environment Creation**: Unique Conda environments are instantiated for each tool, guaranteeing clean, conflict‑free operation.
- **Portability Across Tasks**: By encapsulating tools within isolated environments, Alita allows the same MCP to be reused in multiple contexts without system‑wide modifications.

## 5. Integration into the MCP Box for Reusability
Validated tools are encapsulated as MCP servers and stored in the **MCP Box**, a centralized repository of reusable components. This integration provides:

- **Self‑Evolving Knowledge Base**: Future tasks can draw upon previously created MCPs, reducing redundant development.
- **Cross‑Agent Collaboration**: MCPs generated by one agent become available to others, enhancing overall system capability (e.g., the YouTube Video Subtitle Crawler MCP can be shared across agents).

## 6. Scalability and Adaptability Through Minimal Predefinition
Alita’s architecture prioritizes minimal predefinition and maximal self‑evolution:

- **Minimal Predefinition**: A small set of core components (web agent, manager agent) suffices to trigger tool creation, avoiding complex hardcoded workflows.
- **Maximal Self‑Evolution**: The ability to generate, refine, and reuse MCPs allows the system to scale its capabilities organically, adapting to new domains without manual intervention.

## 7. Empirical Validation and Performance Benefits
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Alita’s dynamic MCP creation:

- **Benchmark Performance**: On GAIA, Alita achieves 75.15 % pass@1 and 87.27 % pass@3, outperforming systems with significantly more handcrafted complexity.
- **Cross‑Ecosystem Compatibility**: MCPs such as the YouTube subtitle extractor function seamlessly with mainstream Python tools, illustrating broad applicability.
- **Enhanced Creativity**: Autonomous tool generation enables agents to compose novel solutions, overcoming limitations of rigid, pre‑defined workflows.

## 8. Limitations and Considerations
While powerful, the approach has constraints:

- **LLM Coding Dependency**: The quality of generated tools hinges on the underlying language model’s coding proficiency; complex programming tasks may yield suboptimal MCPs.
- **Resource Overhead**: Generating and validating tools consumes computational resources, which may impact performance in constrained environments.

## 9. Conclusion
Alita equips agents with the capability to create and deploy MCP tools on demand when existing tools are insufficient. By combining **MCP Brainstorming**, **ScriptGeneratingTool**, and **CodeRunningTool** within a robust environment management framework, Alita ensures that newly generated tools are reliable, reusable, and portable. The MCP Box serves as a self‑evolving repository, fostering scalability and cross‑agent collaboration. Empirical evidence confirms that this dynamic, minimal‑predefinition strategy delivers superior performance across diverse benchmarks, validating Alita’s approach to autonomous tool creation and deployment.
